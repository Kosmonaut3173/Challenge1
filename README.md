# Challenge1

## Description

Client tasked us with refactoring the existing code to meet accessibility standards so that their site was optimized for search engines. Added semantic html elements. Concenced CSS code.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


## Changes made to site code:

1. Looked over HTML file and saw that the body consisted of just divs. Added headed, main, and footer tags.
2. Added alt attributes to the images used in the html file.
3. Simplified classes used so that elements with the same CSS rules could be groupd together, thus condesing the code used in CSS.
4. Added id to "Search Engine Optimization" div to enable first link in nav bar
